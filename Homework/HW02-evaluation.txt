---------
Nice work on this assignment.

On 5.2, good case made for rule-based architecture, although that is usually
reserved for an 'expert system'.  Those are very interesting, actually, and
are quite useful for diagnostic type applications.  It raises an interesting
idea, though, and I think I'll put some time into making a tic-tac-toe game
for my CMSI 627 class as a demonstration!  Thanks for the idea!

On 5.6 again a good case for your selection.  Did you consider a File-based
architecture at all?  Since each drawing is its own file, that might be
another way of thinking about it.

On 5.8 there are a couple of options missing.  For example, what if the user
input starts directly with a number, and has no plus or minus as the first
character?  Also, you don't specifically handle the decimal point character,
and again you are forcing the number to have a sign in the exponent even if
it is positive where the sign is implied.

On 6.2, as professional-looking as everything else is in this submission, I
would respectfully suggest downloading a drawing application of some form so
that your diagrams reflect the care and thought you've obviously put into
this document.

Good job overall, and keep it up ~ you two are doing very well!!
