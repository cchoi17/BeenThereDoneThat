Total possible score: 50 points
============================================================================

Your score: 46 out of 50 = 92% which is an A-minus

Comments/feedback:

problem 7-2: Good insight on those reasons.

problem 7-5: Good call on handling errors in the CALLER, not the CALLED.

problem 7-7: I like Snickers, but I like Kit-Kat better...  :grin:  I'll
   happily settle, though!

problem 8-9: Actually, exhaustive testing is BLACK box, not WHITE box, since
   all you need is the list of inputs and the matching outputs.  You don't
   need to know anything about how the innards work for this, although if
   you are the person that must correct any problems, THEN you would need to
   understand what's inside.  Still, you made a decent case for your answer.

Problem 8-11: The Lincoln index counts product of bugs divided by bugs in
   common.  In the example Alice finds 5 and Bob finds 4, and there are two
   bugs they found *in common*.  Thus their index is (5 * 4) / 2 or 10 bugs.
   Since there are three combinations of two, you must take the average of
   all three calculations which comes out to 14 bugs.

Good job!!

It has been a great pleasure to have you folks in my classes over the years,
and I look forward to hearing from you as you make your marks upon the world
and the industry.  Keep up the good work!
