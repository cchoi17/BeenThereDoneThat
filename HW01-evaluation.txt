Comments:
---------

problem 4.2 the critical path should be G -> D -> E -> M -> Q for 32 days.
   The critical path you have specified has no way to get from N to P.

problem 4.4 there are no dates in your Gantt chart other than the months and
   the start of the week.  I can't tell if you are starting the project on
   New Year's Day, which was specified as a WEDNESDAY not a Monday.  I don't
   see any indication that you are taking off the other holidays mentioned.
   This needs a bit more detail.  The finish date is March 18th, and should
   be February 18th.

problem 5.3 although a good case could be made for your selections, actually
   the options should be categorized as:
      User: b, c, d, l, m, n, o, p
      Business: a
      Functional: b, c, d, j, k, l, m, n, o, p
      Non-functional: e, f, g, h, i
      Implementation: empty

problem 5.9 nice job on the additional requirements; I really like the idea
   of having categories!

Good job overall on the assignment.  You're going strong!
