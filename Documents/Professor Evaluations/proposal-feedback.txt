Been There Done That project
==============================

Proposal Document:
------------------
   Very nice work on the proposal document.  The explanation of your project
   is complete and situates the development well.  You have a good tie-in to
   why this is a good project for you as well as how it will use what you've
   learned.  It also has a nice 'self-reflective' component in which you
   evaluate your potential for succes.  The use of agile to help in planning
   and development is a great idea.

   Good job!

Proposal Presentation:
----------------------
   Really like your presentation!  The color scheme is unique and the green
   and white checkerboard is eye-catching.  The graphics are cute and fun as
   well.  You talked to the audience and gave us what we needed to know and
   didn't read the slides so we felt like you were interacting with us.  You
   have very good presenting skill!

your score:  5% out of 5% which is an A-plus

Great job on this presentation and proposal and great start to the semester!
