Software Requirements Specification Document:
---------------------------------------------
-- Introduction Section
   Very nice job on this section.  The diagram is very good and quite a help
   in understanding the parts and their relationships.  Excellent work!

-- Functional Requirements
   For this section and the next, you have too much in each requirement, and
   not enough requirements overall.  When doing a waterfall SRS, you'll want
   to have each numbered requirement be ONE SENTENCE.  If you have more than
   one, you need to split them up into separate requirements, each with its
   own number.  Also, if you see the word "and" in a requirement, that is an
   indication again that there are two requirements there.

   That being said, you need to have MORE requirements even still.  The SRS
   should *fully* specify the application.  This means that the model part
   should have more than two requirements, or even after splitting them, it
   needs more than ten.  Here's an example using requirement 5.2.2.1:

   IS:
   5.2.2.1 When the controller requests FireBase for user authentication,
           FireBase shall run that request, looking for that email and seeing
           if the password associated with that email matches the one the user
           inputted. If it does, it passes the data along to the controller.

   SHOULD BE:
   5.2.2.1 The model CSU shall be implemented using FireBase.
   5.2.2.2 The model shall accept requests from the controller.
           One type of controller request will be for user authentication
   5.2.2.3 The model shall run authentication requests by passing them to
           Firebase.
           Authentication requests will include the user's e-mail address.
           Authentication requests will include the user's password.
   5.2.2.4 The model shall, using Firebase built-in functions, find records
           matching the e-mail address.
   5.2.2.5 The model shall, upon matching a record to the e-mail contained
           in the authentication request, compare the password from the
           authentication reqest with the password from the matched record.
   5.2.2.6 Properly matched authentication data shall be returned to the
           controller.

   This is the kind of specificity that is needed for requirements.  Yeah,
   it's a lot..... :)

-- Performance Requirements
   The same thing applies to this section as to the previous section.

-- Environment Requirements
   Perfect!  No additional comments on this section.


=============================================================================
your score:  9% out of 10% which is an A-minus

All in all, pretty good first effort, you just need to fill in more specifics
as I showed above.

Make the changes as suggested above for the second submission, including many
more requirements, and you'll get the full 10% on this document.

=============================================================================
SECOND EVALUATION:

your score:  10% out of 10% which is an A-plus

Nice work on the expanded requirements!  Now you're thinking!  Keep up the
good work, now that you have the idea.
